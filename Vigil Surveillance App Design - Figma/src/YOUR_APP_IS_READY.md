## Critical Files for You to Know

### When Editing Code

**Main App Logic:**
- `/src/App.jsx` - Main application component

**Styling:**
- `/src/styles/globals.css` - All theme colors & styles

**Key Components (in /components root):**
- `ModernSecurityLayout.tsx` - Main dashboard layout
- `DVRCameraGrid.tsx` - Camera grid (9 cameras)
- `LoginScreen.tsx` - Login interface (also in /src/components)
- `AnalyticsView.tsx` - Charts & analytics
- `IncidentsView.tsx` - Incident management
- `AIModelManagement.tsx` - AI models

**Note:** TypeScript files (.tsx) in /components root still work because:
- Webpack is configured to handle them
- They import correctly
- Everything compiles fine
- You can convert to .jsx later if desired (conversion script exists)

---

## Immediate First Edits You Can Make

### 1. Change App Name (2 minutes)

**File:** `/public/index.html` (line 8)
```html
<title>Your Surveillance System</title>
```

**File:** `/components/VigilLogo.tsx` (line 32)
```tsx
<span>Your Company</span>
```

### 2. Change Primary Color (3 minutes)

**File:** `/src/styles/globals.css` (line 72)
```css
--vigil-primary: #your-hex-color;
```

### 3. Modify Camera Names (5 minutes)

**File:** `/components/DVRCameraGrid.tsx` (lines 30-80)
```javascript
const cameras = [
  { id: 1, name: 'Your Camera 1', location: 'Your Location' },
  // ... edit all 9
];
```

---

## How Backend Integration Will Work (Later)

### Current (Frontend Only)
```
[Browser] ← → [React App with Demo Data]
```

### After Backend (Future)
```
[Browser] ← → [React App] ← → [Your API] ← → [Database]
                                    ↓
                              [AI Models]
                              [Camera Streams]
```

**Everything documented in BACKEND_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md**
